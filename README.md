# CSCI481/581 Deep Learning

This is a repository for my submission (python scripts/files and project report of our performance) for our final project. There were 5 tasks available, and the first task dealt with applying a Deep Learning concept to human conversation audio files (.WAVs) and determining if two separate audio files came from the same speaker or if they were different. The project data for all 5 tasks is licensed by the university for this project and is not public.
